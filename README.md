# hello-world
This program creates a simple "Hello world!" program.
My name is Brandon, and I am a new programmer. Although I initially started my secondary education in electrical engineering, I changed to business as it fit my interests at that time. This was a surprising move to many as I was highly interested in computers as a hobby while I was in middle and high school. 

After graduating from University of Missouri - Kansas City with my degree in business, I found work with the Social Security Administration. Although not a computer science job itself, my job as a Benefit Authorizer practiced many skills that one who fields himself in computer science would do. My primary mission was to use a mainframe-style GUI to code changes to beneficiary records. Thie process of learning this skill not only included mastery of a proprietary and therefore unique system, but also in depth knowledge of Social Security laws, procedures, and practices. 

After five years of that job, I was promoted to an instructor to train new hires in the job I had previously done. In addition to the obvious duties of preparing, teaching, and mentoring trainees, I also was part of a team that discussed and implemented new ideas as to how to go about processing our workloads. These implementations included both technical and subjective discussions. After two years of training, I was promoted to one of three team leads, out of a team of twenty four instructors. At that level my job was essentially that of a project manager.

In a recent move to Denver, Colorado, I chose to take on a different career within Social Security as a Field Office Service Representative. Although this job was completely different, it has improved my skills with people by working with a wide variety and diverse public. 

I have started coding again as an adult as a hobby, but may look into this in the future as a potential career opportunity.
